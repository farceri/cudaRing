# cudaRing
Deformable particle simulator for molecular dynamics and energy minimization, written in CUDA and C++

Current version includes:
- Inaccessible ring polymer model for deformable particles in 2D
- Rigid ring polymer model for rigid particles of different shape in 2D
- Molecular dynamics in the NVE and NVT ensembles
- Interaction potentials: harmonic, Lennard-Jones, WCA and adhesive potential
- Active brownian model for self-propulsion
